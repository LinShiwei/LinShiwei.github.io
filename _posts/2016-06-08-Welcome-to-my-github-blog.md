Welcome to my github blog! I am now learning Swift programming language and have developed some iOS apps for practice.

I used to learn Swift from books. But most of books are so out-of-date that I could hardly catch up with the latest version of Swift and Xcode. As soon as I realized that, I started to learn from the Internet. Google, StackOverflow and Github help me a lot. I still keep on going. Thank you for your visiting!
